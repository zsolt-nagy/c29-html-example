# Our first HTML page

Hosted on [https://zsolt-nagy.github.io/c29-html-example/](https://zsolt-nagy.github.io/c29-html-example/).

The structure of this site was inspired by 
[http://findmatthew.com/](http://findmatthew.com/) by Mathew Williams.

Form field animation source of inspiration: [https://codepen.io/ishan-chhabra/pen/PooPGwK](https://codepen.io/ishan-chhabra/pen/PooPGwK)

- I corrected the erroneous behavior of this code: when the input field is not
empty, the label shouldn't return to the center of the input field. 
- I also added textarea support for this feature and customized it to match the
styles of this website.
